HR Analytics

Data mining models for predicting employee attrition.

The repository contains a suite of R files that perform analytics on the HR Kaggle Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics). The dependent variable is "Left" which is a binary variable( 1 for employee has left the company, 0 for employee has not left the company)

Each file contains a different predictive algorithm that is used to make the predictions. The best results are observed from the ensemble methods and classification tree.

The associationrules.R file provides market basket analysis on the data.
